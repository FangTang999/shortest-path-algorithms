# Shortest-Path Problem

This project is to demonstrate implementations and applications of shortest-path (SP) algorithms (mainly modified label-correcting (MLC) algorithms). 

It will include the following sub-projects.

1. Efficient implementations of shortest-path algorithms through selecting proper data structures;
2. Parallel implementation of the all-pair shortest-path (APSP) aglorithms;
3. Implementation of k-shortest-paths (KSP) algorithm (i.e., Yen's algorithm);
4. Static User Equilibrium (UE) Traffic Assignment using Frank-Wolfe algorithm;
5. Minimum Cost Flow Problem with capacity constraint using Lagrangian Relaxation.

Some others might include implemenations of heaps suitable for SP algorithms (i.e, with decrease-key(h, newval, i) operation/iterface) to further improve the performances of SP algorithms. Specifically, 

1. Implementation of binary heap;
2. Implementation of Fibonacci heap.

Three major goals are made to this project.

1.	Efficiency. The examples are implemented towards the running speed required by enterprise-level applications. 
2.	Minimum dependency with no compromise on performance. Only facilities from the Python Standard Library are utilized. No any other third-party libraries. Portability is achieved simultaneously as the result of minimum dependency.
3.	Readability. Implementations are made as close as the pseudo codes.
